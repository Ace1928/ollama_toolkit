# Ollama Toolkit Conventions

This document outlines the conventions used across the Ollama Toolkit.

## Model Names
Latest recommended default model is `deepseek-r1:1.5b`. Other examples:
- `qwen2.5:0.5b`
- `nomic-embed-text`

The tag is optional and, if not provided, will default to `latest`. The tag is used to identify a specific version.

## Durations

All durations remain in nanoseconds.

## Streaming Responses

Set `{"stream": true}` or `{"stream": false}` in request JSON.

Certain endpoints stream responses as JSON objects. Streaming can be disabled by providing `{"stream": false}` for these endpoints.
